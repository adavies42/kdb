Project maintainers can find additional resources in the [FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet](https://odp.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/).

- FINOS meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of FINOS and the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws.
